            Looking at this website's about page, there is a clear indication of bias and propaganda towards the "exploration of what is true and valuable in the Southern tradition." 
            Before even digging deeper, this should tell what intention there is to come from this website's contents and posts. Looking deeper, though, there is even worse. Not even a 
            few days ago, there was a letter posted on March 26, 2025, named "Make Arlington Great Again: An Open Letter to President Trump." To keep it brief, it's a huge suck-up to 
            President Donald Trump and a request for a “Reconciliation Monument” in Arlington National Cemetery, an "artistic and historic masterpiece". This whole website is extremely 
            conservative and is used to bring back the history of Southern values and traditions.

            About the Author By Clyde Wilson there are plenty of blog posts about war in the south and there seems to be a certain bias. A quick google search will tell us his overview of his 
            commentary on an American retired professor of history at the University of South Carolina, a paleoconservative political commentator. Paleoconservatism is a conservative idea that 
            stresses tradition, limited government and civil society, along with religious, national and Western identity.

            The notion that the Civil War’s cause wasn’t a product of today's historians. The ideology of downplaying slavery and, in turn, making the justification for another reason for the 
            rage of this war came from Edward A. Pollard, a wartime editor. He published a novel on his findings and interpretations of how the war should be perceived. In summary, its an 
            interpretation of the American Civil War that seeks to present the war from the perspective of Confederates (The Confederates were the citizens and military forces of the Confederate 
            States of America (CSA), a group of 11 Southern states that seceded from the United States during the American Civil War.).

            A quick and informative 5-minute YouTube video titled "Was the Civil War About Slavery?" sums up the whole argument and possible misinformation that led to this 
            becoming a question. Before Lincoln was made president, there were already talks of whether the extinction of slavery was on their horizon. Because of that, once it was 
            announced that Lincoln had won, they revealed they were leaving the union. The North produced far more food crops than the South. But northern farmers had to pay their 
            farmhands, who could come and go as they pleased, while southern plantations exploited those over whom they had total control. The YouTube video ultimately gets to the 
            point of slavery being the number one cause of this conflict and does so by debunking local myths that people still hang on to. In addition, something to note about 
            PragerU is that it creates free educational content promoting American values, which in description is probably not so bad, but it helps to know that they are 
            conservative and something like this topic would kind of be against what they usually go for.

            Developed by white Southerners, many of them former Confederate generals, in a postwar climate of economic, racial, and social uncertainty, the Lost Cause created and romanticized 
            the “Old South” and the Confederate war effort, often distorting history in the process. For this reason, many historians have labeled the Lost Cause a myth or a legend. It is an 
            important example of public memory, one in which nostalgia for the Confederate past is accompanied by a collective forgetting of the horrors of slavery. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Providing a sense of relief to white Southerners who feared being dishonored by defeat, the Lost Cause was largely accepted in the years following the war by white Americans who 
            found it to be a useful tool in reconciling North and South. Because think about it, what other way could the South go about trying to make less of their need for justification for 
            being racist? The only way it would play out better for the South was to find a way to sizzle their way out by blaming it for other reasons. The Lost Cause has lost much of its 
            academic support.
