        TTR (Truth Trust Revolution) aims to deliver in each sector of its label, from the media of questionable titles that come out of the government to the 
        coincidences and answers to our minor inconveniences. Our agency upholds the human need to seek the truth in what remains without explanation. 
        In our detective team of 600,000, with the support of $50 million from funding, it is a desire to keep the trust of all information to be published once found in 
        relevant evidence. We will revolutionize the world with the proper information in hopes that the world can move as it was told, and no information should be gatekept 
        from the public. </h2>
